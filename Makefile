# Normal command to build IMAP toolkit:
#  make <port> [EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS=xxx] [EXTRADRIVERS=xxx] [EXTRACFLAGS=xxx]
#	       [PASSWDTYPE=xxx] [SSLTYPE=xxx] [IP=n]


# Port name.  These refer to the *standard* compiler on the given system.
# This means, for example, that the hpx port is for HP's compiler and not for
# a non-standard compiler such as gcc.
#
# If you are using gcc and it is not the standard compiler on your system, try
# using an ANSI port that is close to what you have.  For example, if your
# system is SVR4ish, try a32 or lnx; if it's more BSDish, try nxt, mct, or bsi.

# The following IP protocol versions are defined:
# o	IPv4 support, no DNS (truly ancient systems)
# 4	(default) IPv4 support only
# 6	IPv6 and IPv4 support

IP=4
IP6=6


# The following extra compilation flags are defined.  None of these flags are
# recommended.  If you use these, include them in the EXTRACFLAGS.
#
# -DDISABLE_POP_PROXY
#	By default, the ipop[23]d servers offer POP->IMAP proxy access,
#	which allow a POP client to access mail on an IMAP server by using the
#	POP server as a go-between.  Setting this option disables this
#	facility.
#
# -DOLDFILESUFFIX=\"xxx\"
#	Change the default suffix appended to the backup .newsrc file from
#	"old".
#
# -DSTRICT_RFC822_TIMEZONES
#	Disable recognition of the non-standard UTC (0000), MET (+0100),
#	EET (+0200), JST (+0900), ADT (-0300), AST (-0400), YDT (-0800),
#	YST (-0900), and HST (-1000) symbolic timezones.
#
# -DBRITISH_SUMMER_TIME
#	Enables recognition of non-standard symbolic timezone BST as +0100.
#
# -DBERING_STANDARD_TIME
#	Enables recognition of non-standard symbolic timezone BST as -1100.
#
# -DNEWFOUNDLAND_STANDARD_TIME
#	Enables recognition of non-standard symbolic timezone NST as -0330.
#
# -DNOME_STANDARD_TIME
#	Enables recognition of non-standard symbolic timezone NST as -1100.
#
# -DSAMOA_STANDARD_TIME
#	Enables recognition of non-standard symbolic timezone SST as -1100.
#				
# -DY4KBUGFIX
#	Turn on the Y4K bugfix (yes, that's year 4000).  It isn't well-known,
#	but century years evenly divisible by 4000 are *not* leap years in the
#	Gregorian calendar.  A lot of "Y2K compilant" software does not know
#	about this rule.  Remember to turn this on sometime in the next 2000
#	years.
#
# -DUSEORTHODOXCALENDAR
#	Use the more accurate Eastern Orthodox calendar instead of the
#	Gregorian calendar.  The century years which are leap years happen
#	at alternating 400 and 500 year intervals without shifts every 4000
#	years.  The Orthodox and Gregorian calendars diverge by 1 day for
#	gradually-increasing intervals, starting at 2800-2900, and becoming
#	permanent at 48,300.
#
# -DUSEJULIANCALENDAR
#	Use the less accurate Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian
#	calendar.  Leap years are every 4 years, including century years.
#	My apologies to those in the English-speaking world who object to
#	the reform of September 2, 1752 -> September 14, 1752, since this
#	code still uses January 1 (which Julius Ceasar decreed as the start
#	of the year, which since 153 BCE was the day that Roman consuls
#	took office), rather than the traditional March 25 used by the
#	British.  As of 2005, the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar
#	diverge by 15 days.
