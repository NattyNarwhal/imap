			    UNIX QUICK BUILD NOTES

These quick build notes assume that you have installed OpenSSL before
attempting to build this software, and that you do not have any non-default
configuration parameters.

If you need additional information in building this software with OpenSSL,
please refer to the docs/SSLBUILD file for more information.

If you intend to build this software with a non-default configuration
(including building a non-compliant server without SSL support), please
refer to the docs/BUILD file for more information.

1) Look in the top-level Makefile and find your system type code.  For example,
   modern versions of Linux will use either "slx", "lnp", or one of the
   lnp-variants (such as "lrh").

2) Type "make" followed by the system type, e.g. "make slx".

3) Install the POP2 daemon (ipopd/ipop2d), the POP3 daemon (ipopd/ipop3d), and
   the IMAP daemon (imapd/imapd) on a system directory of your choosing.

4) Update /etc/services to register the pop2 service on TCP port 109, the
   pop3 service on TCP port 110, and the imap service on TCP port 143.  Also
   update Yellow Pages/NIS/NetInfo/etc. if appropriate on your system.

5) Update /etc/inetd.conf (or install files on /etc/xinetd.d) to invoke the
   POP2, POP3, and IMAP daemons on their associated services.

6) If your system uses PAM authentication, be sure to set up /etc/pam.d/imap
   (*not* /etc/pam.d/imapd) and /etc/pam.d/pop (*not* /etc/pam.d/ipop3d or
   /etc/pam.d/pop3d or /etc/pam.d/popd or /etc/pam.d/pop3).

7) Unless you built your system without SSL support, you will need to set
   up SSL server certificates as described in docs/SSLBUILD.

6) That's all!

Read the file docs/BUILD and docs/SSLBUILD if you need more detailed
information and/or you don't understand these quick build instructions.

			     MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

     mtest has been run under UNIX, DOS, Windows, NT, Macintosh, TOPS-20, and
VMS.  It is a very primitive interface, however, and is suited mainly as a
model of how to write a main program for c-client.  You should take a look at
the source to figure out how to use it.  Briefly, it first asks for a mailbox
name (either a local file path or an IMAP mailbox in the form
"{hostname}mailbox") and then puts you in a command mode where "?" will give
you a list of commands.

     Pine is available separately on the FTP.CAC.Washington.EDU archives.

     The focus of development and support is for UNIX and Win32 (including
Windows 95/98/Millenium, Windows NT, and Windows 2000).  The other ports are
not frequently used or tested, and may be incomplete.
